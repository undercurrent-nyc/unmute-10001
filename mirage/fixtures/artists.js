Ada Van Hoorebeke (b. 1982, Kortrijk) lives and works in Berlin and places in Belgium.

Over the last fourteen years, I have researched painting with wax (Batik) and
ways to produce my own colors and dyes with natural waste materials. My
installations reflect on handwork, production chains, “female thinking” and
the need to communicate through creation. I want to share how storytelling,
humor, and learning are interrelated and should be stimulated to reinvent our
world. Through handwork sessions such as textile dyeing, photo shoots and
performances, I want to engage the viewer physically in this research.

Van Hoorebeke obtained an MA in painting in Antwerp (KASK) in 2006 and learned
batik and natural dyeing techniques from artists and craftsmen in Serekunda
(Mbye Ceesay) in 2006 & 2011 and in Yogyakarta (Bixa Batik) in 2016. Among
other places, she was Artist in Residence at: [R.U. in New York
City](https://www.residencyunlimited.org) (2017); [AIR
Frankfurt](https://www.transartists.org/air/KulturFrankfurt) (2017); [Be-Part,
Platform for contemporary art Waregem](http://www.bepartlive.org) (2016);
[WIELS Contemporary Art Centre](http://www.wiels.org/en/), Brussels, 2010. Van
Hoorebeke works in long-term collaborations with different artists and groups
developing projects such as “Fake Calligraphy,” “Private Fountains, Public
Baths,” and solo projects such as “Lace Simulations,” and “Where Batik
Belongs.”  Her work has been supported multiple times by Flanders State of the
Art and by the Senate for Culture and Europe in Berlin. She was one of [Berlin
Art Prize winners of 2019](http://flandersartsinstitute.p.a.mrhenry.eu/news/5692-ada-van-hoorebeke-one-of-the-three-winners-of-the-berlin-art-prize).

const chouaBio = `
“Am I the only one who is like me?” is a question characteristic of Saddie Choua’s life and work. It problematizes the position of the solitary I that is never disconnected from the other. The power order that conditions the solitary “I” is another central subject.  Where does this otherness sit in the hierarchy of power? Where is her oppression and exploitation concealed or exoticed? She asks us to think about how we consume images and dialogues about the other and how they affect our self-image and historical consciousness. How can we intervene in the images that write our history and conceal social struggle? Do we first have to refute memory to tell another story? Or is the removal or recombining of certain associations and references already sufficient to create a different history and self-image? Saddie Choua's work can therefore be read as a fragmented self-reflective visual essay that questions the relationship between maker and image. How do you make blind spots that just invite you to forget visible? How to speak and depict differently from a subalternal position, or is it just the concept of “the other” that confines her in dominant images and narratives?

Saddie Choua (b. Brussels) uses meta-documentary tactics, collage, re-appropriation of popular intercultural formats, and autiobiographical elements to put racism, discrimination against women and class, and her cats in the spotlight. She creates a new pseudo-realistic imaginary world that is at once highly recognizable and utterly alien. It is her way of undermining the (visual) language of our media and sharpening the critical and political gaze of her audience. The challenge is to create “situations” that reveal the power structures behind the images that we internalize and reproduce.

Saddie Choua (PhD arts [RITCS](https://www.ritcs.be/en/ritcs-school-arts) and finalist Belgian Art Prize, 2020) has had residences and solo- and group exhibitions including [BOZAR](https://www.bozar.be/en) in Brussels, [WIELS](http://www.wiels.org/en/) in Brussels, [Cité International des Arts](https://www.citedesartsparis.net) in Paris, the [Marrakech Biennial](https://www.biennialfoundation.org/biennials/arts-in-marrakech-international-biennale-morocco/), [MU.ZEE](https://www.muzee.be) in Ostend, [Sint Lucas School of Arts](https://www.luca-arts.be/nl) in Antwerp, [KIOSK](http://www.kioskgallery.be) in Ghent; the [Festival Concreto](https://www.festivalconcreto.com.br) in Fortaleza, [Kooshk-Air](http://kooshkresidency.com) in Antwerp and Tehran, Kanal-Centre Pompidou in Brussels, [Savvy Contemporary](https://www.savvy-contemporary.com) in Berlin, [Akademie der Künste der Welt-Richas Digest](https://www.adkdw.org/en/) in Cologne, [Villa Empain](https://www.villaempain.com/en/) in Brussels, Laboratoire Bx in Bordeaux, [Contour Biennal](https://contour9.be/en/contour/index.html) in Mechelen, the [Biennale Warszawa](https://biennalewarszawa.pl/en/), the [Kunsthal in Ghent](https://kunsthal.gent/en/), the [Kunsthalle in Vienna](https://kunsthallewien.at/en/),  [Temporary Gallery](https://www.temporarygallery.org/en/homepage-2/) in Cologne, the [Centre Wallonie-Bruxelles](https://www.cwb.fr) in Paris, and at [Residency Unlimited](https://www.residencyunlimited.org) in NY.

const mediodiaBio = `
Ieva Mediodia (b. 1968) left Lithuania in 1996 to study contemporary painting at an MFA program at Hunter College New York.

Since graduating from Vilnius Art Academy (1992) and Hunter College (2001), she has participated internationally in numerous exhibitions in France, Finland, Romania, Italy, as well as many in Lithuania and the USA. Notably, Mediodia was represented by the prominent [Annina Nosei](http://anninanoseigallery.com) gallery in Chelsea, New York, which has exposed her work to a larger audience in Europe and the US.

In the process of painting, composition emerges organically into mental maps, starting with a mark or random spill of paint on a blank surface. The work is a hybrid of painting and drawing and sometimes installation, accomplished with fluid acrylics and ink using paintbrush, pen, and airbrush on various surfaces—mostly on canvas, Mylar, and translucent acetate paper.

Anna is an artist, woodcarver and carpenter. In 2014, she launched [The Whole Elements](https://www.thewholeelements.com/about-1), a design studio and wood workshop. Dedicated to creating furniture pieces, crafted by hand from wood, the brand is notable for its bridging of art and design, with inspiration coming from Anna's observations of the relationship between humans and nature — from a biological, spiritual, and cultural perspective. The artist focuses on the ways the objects are used, as well as on their ritualistic significance in everyday life. Anna's sculptural furniture does not reveal its functionality, instead encouraging the users to explore and give it their own meaning. Her works have been exhibited in Poland and abroad, including in New York, Milan, Stockholm, and Seoul, as well as in the United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, and Iceland.
