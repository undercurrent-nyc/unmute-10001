In addition to collaborative projects with musicians, her interest in the visual arts has inspired her to collaborate with a number of artists on various interdisciplinary projects, such as “Daria's Vision” with fine artist Ruth Bianco and the multidisciplinary project “[Ġgantija 2013](https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-08-26/arts-and-culture/ggantija-2013-project-final-exhibition-6346801152/)” with visual artist Victor Agius and writer Immanuel Mifsud, inspired by the Ġgantija megalithic temples on the island of Gozo, a Unesco world heritage site. All of these projects, supported by the [Malta Arts Fund](https://www.artscouncilmalta.org/funds/malta-arts-fund), were inspired by diverse sources, such as classic movies, and historical spaces and sounds from the Maltese landscape.

Cassar-Cordina has been a member of jury panels in a number of music festivals, including the [Malta International Choir Festival](https://maltachoirfest.com).
