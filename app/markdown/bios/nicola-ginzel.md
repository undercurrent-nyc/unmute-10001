Mixed media installation artist Nicola Ginzel lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and works at the Old American Can Factory in the Gowanus.  She is a recipient of a 2019–20 [Fulbright US Scholar Grant](https://www.fulbright.at/programs/in-austria/current-grantees/grantee-detail?tx_fulbrighterslive_fulbrighterslive%5Baction%5D=show&tx_fulbrighterslive_fulbrighterslive%5Bcontroller%5D=FulbrightersLive&tx_fulbrighterslive_fulbrighterslive%5Bgrantee%5D=245&cHash=e3ff56765485ef5af075c04ee396af6f), which enabled her to participate in the [Q21 Artist-in-Residence Program at the Museusmsquartier](http://www.quartier21.at) in Vienna, Austria, during the spring of 2020.

Other residencies include [SIM](https://sim.is/seljavegur-residency/), The Icelandic Visual Arts Association and Reykjavik Art Museum Residency; The Skaftfell Cultural Center Residency in Seydisfjördur, Iceland; and [BoxoPROJECTS](https://boxoprojects.com) in Joshua Tree, CA where she worked together with shamans in the community.

Her work has been featured by selected venues such as Hyperallergic, in John Yau’s “[An Artist who turns Detritus into Talismans](https://hyperallergic.com/446963/an-artist-who-turns-detritus-into-talismans/)” in [_Artcritical_](https://artcritical.com/2015/12/08/stephanie-buhmann-on-nicola-ginzel/) by Stephanie Buhmann, in _Art in America_ by Janet Koplos, and in [_The Philadelphia Inquirer_](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/entertainment/20080229_A_wide-ranging_show_at_Fleisher_Ollman_.html) by Edith Newhall. Her Frottage Prints—created by using her own stitched, transformed ephemera as a printing plate—have been coined “The Ginzel Method” by Maryland Institute of Art’s Whitney Sherman.

Ginzel had her first ten–year retrospective and traveling museum exhibition, “[Language, Symbol, Artifact](https://tennesseevalleyarts.org)” at the Tennessee Valley Museum of Art in Tuscumbia, AL, with other selected solo exhibitions at [Cathouse FUNeral](http://daviddixon.net/cathouse_funeral/index_cathouse-firstpage.html) curated by David Dixon in Brookly, the [Gallery@1GAP](https://www.spenceprojects.com/nicola-ginzel) curated by Spence Projects in Brooklyn, and the Corridor Gallery in Reykjavik, Iceland, curated by Helgi Thorgils Frí∂jónsson.

Selected group exhibitions include “[Hiding in Plain Sight Objects Common and Curious](https://www.freedmanart.com/exhibitions/hiding-in-plain-sight),” co-curated by Carter Ratcliff, where her work had a room of its own at FreedmanArt in NYC; “[1Ensemble](http://www.daily-lazy.com/2019/01/1ensemble-at-cathouse-proper-brooklyn-ny.html)” at Cathouse Proper in Brooklyn; “Distilled” at [Bernard Jacobson Gallery](https://www.jacobsongallery.com), curated by Diana Erdos in NYC; and, dating back, Cindy Tower's guerilla shows like “Brookworld” and “Coat Check” at MoMA in 2000.
