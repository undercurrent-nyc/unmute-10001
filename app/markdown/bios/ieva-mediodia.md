Ieva Mediodia (b. 1968) left Lithuania in 1996 to study contemporary painting at an MFA program at Hunter College New York.

Since graduating from Vilnius Art Academy (1992) and Hunter College (2001), she has participated internationally in numerous exhibitions in France, Finland, Romania, Italy, as well as many in Lithuania and the USA. Notably, Mediodia was represented by the prominent [Annina Nosei](http://anninanoseigallery.com) gallery in Chelsea, New York, which has exposed her work to a larger audience in Europe and the US.

In the process of painting, composition emerges organically into mental maps, starting with a mark or random spill of paint on a blank surface. The work is a hybrid of painting and drawing and sometimes installation, accomplished with fluid acrylics and ink using paintbrush, pen, and airbrush on various surfacesâ€”mostly on canvas, Mylar, and translucent acetate paper.
