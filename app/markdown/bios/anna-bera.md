Anna is an artist, woodcarver and carpenter. In 2014, she launched [The Whole Elements](https://www.thewholeelements.com/about-1), a design studio and wood workshop. Dedicated to creating furniture pieces, crafted by hand from wood, the brand is notable for its bridging of art and design, with inspiration coming from Anna's observations of the relationship between humans and nature â€” from a biological, spiritual, and cultural perspective. The artist focuses on the ways the objects are used, as well as on their ritualistic significance in everyday life. Anna's sculptural furniture does not reveal its functionality, instead encouraging the users to explore and give it their own meaning. Her works have been exhibited in Poland and abroad, including in New York, Milan, Stockholm, and Seoul, as well as in the United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, and Iceland.
