Carolina Rubio-MacWright is an artist, immigration lawyer, and activist
fighting for immigrant and humanitarian rights. Her experience as an immigrant
and immigration attorney opened her eyes to systems of oppression and how
these intersect, taking people’s freedom away. She believes ART is the most
powerful way of explaining these inequities. She has thus mixed her law and
art into the perfect platform called Touching Land, a program that uses
hands-on experiential arts as a tool for immigrant empowerment and community
building. At Touching Land, immigrants learn about their rights and self-worth
as they make a ceramic piece or learn how to cook by decolonizing food. The
program also has a building bridges track, where cross-cultural exchange
happens as immigrants and American citizens come together to see their
humanity through the power of art.

Whether working on policy campaigns for non-profits, consulting with artist
organizations, speaking at events, or organizing lawyers to volunteer inside
detention centers, Carolina is guided by a simple principle: anything is
possible when inspiring ideas and passionate people come together.
