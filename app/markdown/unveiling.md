 The virtual collaborative project “10001” wraps up on September 11th, 2020,
 with a live presentation from all six participating teams, starting at 1pm,
 EDT.
 
 Back on August 5, [Undercurrent](https://undercurrent.nyc) took twelve
 artists from the European Union, split them into teams of two, and gave them
 a task: to imagine an artistic project over the course of the
 month and record their process—if not progress. The video testimony of
 “10001” has grown on the [teams’ page](/exhibit/teams), and now it is time to
 watch the artists conclude their collaborations.
