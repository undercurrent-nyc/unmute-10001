_Stoff Stuk_ is the first collaboration of interdisciplinary artist Luisa Muhr
(NYC/Austria) and visual artist Ada Van Hoorebeke (Berlin/Flanders). The
piece’s foundation is an experimental, living graphic score, “played” by
artists across disciplines, and deals with the human impact on nature, the
implied imprint that comes with it, nature versus an urban environment, and
with the synesthesia-like dialogue of multi- and interdisciplinary expression.
It looks at a city and asks: how can we be more inclusive and make art more
accessible? How can we serve different communities with diverse backgrounds
through art? What is needed of the arts in a time during and after a
pandemic?, and finally: how can art redefine itself and what is our
responsibility in this process?

“Stoff” is German, meaning “fabric” and “Stuk” is Flemish, meaning “piece,”
not only referring to fabric dying, a big part of the creation of _Stoff Stuk_,
but also to the interconnectedness of different artistic mediums that weave
together the different parts of the journey this piece is taking its audience
on. 

_Stoff Stuk_ is immersive, installation-like, and encourages its audience to be
engaged in its performance, involves artists from a wide spectrum of art
practices, and even gives them space to add to the score itself. 

Its setting, as well as its cast, is fully flexible and can widely vary, while
steadily thriving towards inclusivity. 
 
Describing _Stoff Stuk_ in one phrase, one could simply say: “It is an
experience!”
