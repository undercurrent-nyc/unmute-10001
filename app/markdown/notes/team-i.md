_Careful Nordic Conclusions ðŸŒŽ_ is a test version of a podcast in a style of a
variety show, that narrates together multiple genres of podcasting: comedy
monologues; conversations with scientists, philosophers, visionaries, clowns
and strippers; musical acts; soundscape design; comedy sketches; quasi
religious MC performances; and audio dance instructions. 

In terms of discourse it plays on two perspectives: on the one hand mega
global, zoom out the question what are the intermittent connections between
global events on a human and cosmic level; on the other hand zoomed in
personal perspective, the question howâ€” how can we function, reflect and act
individually. 

In addition, it aims to bring an entirely different texture to post production
â€” instead of it just being a bunch of talking heads and musical slots, we
would like to take our listeners on a cognitive, sensorial and mind-bending
journey â€” which is done through audio manipulation, soundscapes design and in
that way is shifting of perceptions.
